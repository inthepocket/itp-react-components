# ITP Basic React Button üéÅ

### Why is this a separate package? I can just define `<button>` inside my project?

- We need a standard implementation to build upon and to share across projects
- Built-in types
- Built-in tests (todo)
- Built-in loading styling
- Built-in fallback on href prop to `<a>` element
- Built-in spacing between icons, text and other children of button
- Built-in A11Y (WAI-ARIA roles and attributes)
- Built-in ButtonGroup

### API

Inspired by [ant-design button](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/button/index.en-US.md#api) with stripped styling, shares the same API.
